I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of [Computer Science and Automation](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in) at [IISc Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in), advised by Dr. [Sathish Govindarajan](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~gsat). Prior to this, I did my Bachelors in Information Technology at [NIT Durgapur](https://nitdgp.ac.in/) and my Masters in Computer Science at [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in).

Research 
======
My research interests lie in [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science), particularly in [computational geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry) and [approximation algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_algorithm). Theoretical computer science is a vast research area and encompasses topics that are the foundations of computer science. Computational geometry focuses on design and analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures for computational problems in Geometry. Approximation algorithms are efficient algorithms that find approximate solutions to optimization problems (in particular [NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness) problems) with provable guarantees on the distance of the approximate solution to the optimal one.
